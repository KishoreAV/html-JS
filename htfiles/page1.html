    what is HTML?
</H2>
<p>
    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it is a markup language used to tell your browser
    how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wishes it to
    be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content
    to make it appear or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a bit of content into a hyperlink to link to
    another page on the web, italicize words, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:
</p>
<p>
    Elements in HTML are case-insensitive, i.e. they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For example, a &lt;title&gt;
    element could be written as &lt;title&gt;, &lt;TITLE&gt;,
    &lt;Title&gt;, &lt;TiTlE&gt;, etc., and it will work fine. Best practice, however, is to write all elements
    lowercase for consistency, readability, and other reasons.
